# Introduction
My SQL project which I tackled during my downtime 😵, exploring the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles, 💰 top-paying jobs, 🔥 in-demand skills, and 📈 the connection between high demand and high salary in data analytics. 

🔍 SQL queries here: [ project_sql_1 folder](/project_sql_1/)

# Background
The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousse's SQL Course [SQL Course](http://lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills.

**The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:**
1) What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2) What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3) What skills are the most in demand for data analysts?
4) Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5) What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** to query the database, extract valuable insights to answer key questions in my analysis.
- **PostgreSQL:** to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **VSCode (Visual Studio Code):** to manage the database and execute SQL queries effectively. 
- **Git/Github:** Essential for version control, sharing SQL scripts/analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. 

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs: 
I narrowed down data analyst roles based on average salary and location, emphasizing remote jobs to highlight the top-paying opportunites in the field.

```sql
SELECT
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
	name AS company_name
FROM
	job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
-- add company name from company dim table 
WHERE
	job_title_short= 'Data Analyst'
	AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
	AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
	salary_year_avg DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **High Salary Potential:** Data analyst roles can command salaries ranging from $184K to $650K, showcasing substantial earning opportunities in the field.

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs:
To identify the key skills employers seek for top-paying jobs, I combined job postings with skills data.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short= 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC 
    LIMIT 10
) 

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

## 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts:
This query helped determine the skills most frequently resquested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count -- aggregation, so needs GROUP BY...
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY        
    skills
ORDER BY    
    demand_count DESC         
LIMIT 5;
```
- **SQL** and **Excel** are essential, highlighting the importance of foundational data processing and spreadsheet abilities.

## 4. Skills Based on Salary:
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND (AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    -- COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count -- aggregation, so needs GROUP BY...
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY        
    skills
